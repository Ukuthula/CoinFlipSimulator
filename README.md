# Coin Flip Simulator

1. Purpose
I want to test out the Kotlin Programming Language, so i decided to create something simple such as a Coin Flip Simulator.

2. Flip Engine
The  Engine generates numbers 0 or 1 with the Random()-function of the java library.

3. GUI
A simple GUI is helping visualising the flip and acts as a history for flips. Most importantly it allows you to run the Flip Engine in the most easy way by pressing a button.
